iPhone app that acts like a laptop touchpad--only over a wireless network.  Essentially becomes a wireless touchpad.  Future might include a programmable remote, with customizable buttons!  Presentation aid, media center controller, you name it. :-).

Features:

  * Very easy to use!
  * 2-finger scroll! (like a macbook pro!)


No wireless mouse? No problem! :)

Currently in development!

Windows and linux already supported!

Mac--pending testing.

Vista--unknown.
